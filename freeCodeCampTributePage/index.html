<!--
With this project I'm hoping to include git and a github 
profile as well as develop the tribute page concept a little
further than what the assignment parameters require.

maybe I'll be able to add some flare to it with what I'm learning

I will also comment where the assignment requirements are within 
the code so that others who look at my github progress can
compare their solutions.
