# IDEA FOR LANDING PAGE email funnel chat widget

## usecase
#### have page like my beat sales page where an email list or active user retention can take place.

### design
#### designed to act like a live chat box by 
#### displaying a number of previous chat messages 
#### and live messages from a chat service (discord 
#### etc) offering the customer the opportunity to 
#### chat with others after email input

streamline onboarding for beat purchase by early capture of email
