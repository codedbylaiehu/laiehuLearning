                <div id="sectionOne" class="sub-section-content">
                    <p>Live is the result of musicians wanting a better way to create, produce and perform music using a computer. A great deal of effort has been put into making Live easy and fun to use, yet at the same time capable of helping you create music with unlimited depth and sophistication. This effort continues even as you read these lines... in fact, a new, improved Live version might already be available for download! Please check your ableton.com account now https://www.ableton.com/account, or choose the Check for Updates command from the Help menu.</p>
                    <p>We hope you enjoy using Live and that it enhances your creative process.</p> 
                    <p>Your Ableton Team.</p>

                    <span class="sub-title-small">1.2.1 Arrangement View Improvements</span>
                    <p>A new Create Crossfades On Clip Edges command creates four-millisecond crossfades on clip edges. The command is available in the Create menu, and the context menu of Arrangement clips, or via the <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>ALT</kbd>-<kbd>F</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CMD</kbd>-<kbd>ALT</kbd>-<kbd>F</kbd>(Mac) keyboard shortcut.</p>
                    <p>It is possible to change the selection of automation and take lane headers using the up and down arrow keys. The lane header selection can also be extended using <kbd>Shift</kbd> and the up and down arrow keys.</p>
                    <p>You can move automation lanes and take lanes using <code>CTRL</code>(Win) / <code>CMD</code>(Mac) and the up and down arrow keys.</p>
                    <p>Selected automation lanes or take lanes can be resized vertically by pressing <code>ALT</code>-<code>+</code> or <code>ALT</code>-<kbd>-</kbd>, or by pressing <kbd>ALT</kbd> while using the mousewheel/pinch gesture.</p>
                    <p>When using the Zoom to Time Selection command in the Arrangement, Live now only zooms horizontally at first. When using the command a second time (without changing the time selection), Live then zooms vertically as well. Upon using the command a third time, the Arrangement returns to the first vertical zoom state.</p>
                    <p>You can use the left arrow key to navigate from an automation lane or take lane to the main track, this will fold the lanes as well. You can also use the left arrow key to navigate from tracks in a group to the main Group Track.</p>
                    <p>Selected tracks and automation lanes can be folded/unfolded using the left and right arrow keys.</p>
                    <p>You can solo tracks with the <kbd>S</kbd> key and arm tracks with the <kbd>C</kbd> key when take lane headers or automation lane headers are selected.</p>
                    <p>Pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd>/<kbd>Shift</kbd>-<kbd>Tab</kbd> while renaming an Arrangement clip selects the next/previous clip on the same track or take lane.</p>
                    
                    <span class="sub-title-small">1.2.2 Browser Improvements</span>
                    <p>A Templates label (<a href="/en/manual/managing-files-and-sets/#5-5-4-template-sets">see 5.5.4</a>) has been added to the browsers Categories. It shows template Live Sets from factory packs (including the Core Library), the User Library, and other Project folders.</p>
                    <p>A Grooves label (<a href="/en/manual/using-grooves/">see Chapter 13</a>) has also been added. It shows a flat list of all Grooves from the Core Library as well as the User Library.</p>
                    <p>Devices in the Audio Effects label are now grouped into folders. You can unfold more than one folder at once by holding <kbd>CTRL</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CMD</kbd>(Mac).</p>
                    <p>Abletons official Max for Live devices are now listed within the Audio Effects, MIDI Effects, and Instruments labels.</p>
                    <p>The browser receives focus when opened via the <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>ALT</kbd>-<kbd>B</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CMD</kbd>-<kbd>ALT</kbd>-<kbd>B</kbd> (Mac) keyboard shortcut.</p>
                    <p>When viewing and expanding Live Sets in the browser, you will see a new Devices icon for device chains on a track that contain at least one device.</p>

                    <span class="sub-title-small">1.2.3 Capture MIDI Updates</span>
                    <p>Added MPE to Capture MIDI.</p>
                    <p>In the first captured MIDI clip (in an empty set with the transport stopped), if the detected loop is eight bars or less, the first played note is considered the start of the loop.</p>
                    <p>When only one note is played in the first captured MIDI clip (in an empty set with the transport stopped), the loop boundaries are set to the note start and end, and the tempo is accordingly calculated, resulting in a one, two, four, or eight bar loop. This is particularly useful when playing a rhythmical sample with a single MIDI note.</p>
                    <p>In Session View, new captured clips now use the Adaptive Grid: Narrow setting instead of Fixed Grid: 1/16.</p>

                    <p>Live comes with a set of interactive <em>lessons</em> to take you step by step through the key features of the program. The lessons are organized in a table of contents, which can be opened directly in the program via the Help menu. We highly recommend following the lessons. Many users have told us that the lessons helped them become familiar with the program very quickly.</p>
                    <p>We also recommend that you read the Live Concepts chapter (<a href="/en/manual/live-concepts/">see Chapter 4</a>), which encapsulates everything that Live is and can do, and is therefore a worthwhile read for both beginners and experienced users. The remaining chapters of this manual serve as in-depth reference for the material introduced in Live Concepts.</p>

                <div class="sub-section-content">

                    <p>Lives Preferences window is where you can find various settings that determine how Live looks, behaves and interfaces with the outside world. This window is accessed from the Preferences command, which in Windows is available in the Options menu and in macOS is available in the Live menu. Preferences can also be accessed with the <kbd>CTRL</kbd>-<kbd>,</kbd>(Win) / <kbd>CMD</kbd>-<kbd>,</kbd>(Mac) shortcut.</p>
                    <p>Lives Preferences are distributed over several tabs:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the Look/Feel tab, you can modify various settings, including the language used for text display and the color scheme, or “Theme,“ for the Live user interface. This is also where you can adjust the size of objects displayed on the screen: the Zoom Display slider allows you to zoom Lives screen to any percentage between 50% and 200% of the standard interface size.</li>
                        <li>The Audio Preferences are used to set up Lives audio connections with the outside world via an audio interface. Please take the time to follow the programs built-in “Setting up Audio I/O“ lesson, which will walk you through all the steps required to set up and optimize the settings for any given system. To access the lesson, use the Help View command from the Help menu.</li>
                        <li>The Link/Tempo/MIDI Preferences are used to help Live recognize external devices for three separate and distinct purposes:

                    <p>Most of your work in Live happens in the main Live screen.

                    <p>Live is protected against illegal use by a copy protection scheme. This scheme has been designed to meet the highest security standards while avoiding hassles for our customers. If you find this procedure to be an inconvenience, please understand that the copy protection secures your investment: It allows Ableton to provide you with support and to continue developing Live.</p>
                    <p>Please be aware that the standard Live license grants you the right to use Live on only <em>one computer at a time</em>. You can, however, authorize Live more than once under the legal and technical conditions described later (<a href="/en/manual/authorizing-live/#3-1-copy-protection-faqs">see 3.1</a>).</p>
                    <p>The first time you run Live, you will be prompted to complete the authorization process. The software will walk you through the steps.</p>
                    <p>If the computer that you wish to authorize is connected to the internet, you can authorize immediately by pressing the appropriate button in the dialog box. If you do not have an internet connection, press the “No internet on this computer“ button and follow the instructions.</p>

                    <p>If you do not (yet) own Live or its add-on products, you can still try them out, but saving and exporting will be disabled.</p>
                    <p>If trying Live or another product raises your interest in purchasing it, please visit the Ableton webshop<a class="inline-footnote">*</a><span class="footnote-content"><a href="http://www.ableton.com/shop">http://www.ableton.com/shop</a></span>.

                    <span class="sub-title-small">3.1.2 What if I Change My Computers Components?</span> 

                    <p>If you change your computer components for some reason, Live may indeed ask you to authorize the software another time. Live does not need to be reauthorized when computer peripherals are replaced (audio or MIDI hardware, printers, modems). But you may need to authorize again if the motherboard, processor or network card is replaced. On some computers, reformatting a hard drive will require a new authorization.</p>
                
                    <span class="sub-title-small">3.1.3 Can I Authorize Live More than Once?</span>

                    <p>The standard Live license allows you to use Live on only one computer at a time. However, the Ableton server will provide you with two authorizations in good faith that you will use Live on only one machine at a time.</p>
                    <p>You can therefore run Live on both a studio desktop computer and a tour laptop, but not at the same time.</p>
                    <p>Should the Ableton server reject your demand for another authorization, please contact Abletons technical support<a class="inline-footnote">*</a><span class="footnote-content"><a href="http://www.ableton.com/help">http://www.ableton.com/help</a></span>.</p>
                    <p>To use Live on more than one computer at a time, you may require a secondary license or a site license. Ableton offers these licenses at special rates.</p>

                    <p>The basic musical building blocks of Live are called <em>clips</em>. A clip is a piece of musical material: a melody, a drum pattern, a bassline or a complete song. Live allows you to record and alter clips, and to create larger musical structures from them: songs, scores, remixes, DJ sets or stage shows.</p>
                    <p>A Live Set consists of two environments that can hold clips: The <em>Arrangement</em> is a layout of clips along a musical timeline; the <em>Session</em> is a real-time-oriented “launching base” for clips. Every Session clip has its own play button that allows launching the clip at any time and in any order. Each clips behavior upon launch can be precisely specified through a number of settings (<a href="/en/manual/launching-clips/">see Chapter 14</a>).</p>
